## A description of the project: what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned

This project involves the devlopment of code for the construction of ML models for the classification of mRNA, protiens and buffers.   The core aims for this work are:

One. Converting spectral data sets studentexperiemnts specific formats into a common, commer separated value format (*.csv) with annotation that can be used in downstream applications.

Two. Produce accessible Python script for ML classification of mRNA, protiens and buffers in RNA samples, using KNN, randon forester and Multi-layer Perceptron methods.

Three.  Produce accessible Python script for ML regression, to quantify mRNA, protiens and buffers in RNA samples using KNN, randon forester and Multi-layer Perceptron methods.
